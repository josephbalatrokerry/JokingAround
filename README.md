(USES QUANTUM ENHANCEMENTS! May not be compatible with other mods)

# Joker Descriptions:

# 1.0.0 (+10 new Jokers)

# Rare Jokers

## Chisel
XMult Joker that picks a random card from the deck and gains X0.75 XMult when it's destroyed (and then card is changed).

## Dystopia
Gives X1.5 Mult for each card played if they all share the same suit AND played hand is not a Flush. Imagine, a dystopia where you can't play flushes...

## Snowballing Joker
When a blind is selected, sets hands to 1 and retriggers all played cards amount of times equal to how many hands were subtracted.

## Aim
If played hand contains only 1 card, retriggers it 4 times.

# Uncommon Jokers

## Shopaholism
Gains X0.5 XMult for each Joker bought, but resets when a Joker is sold.

## Canvas
Gives +3 hand size until you played your first hand 

## Alloy
Steel cards act like Gold cards and vice versa

# Common Jokers
## Bonus Joker
Gives +30 Chips and +4 Mult for each Bonus and Mult card respectively in your full deck

## Consolidation
(coding this joker was pure pain) Sets sell prices of all Jokers to their buying price. You can essentially return Jokers now (and scale Campfire)

## Income Report
Mult scaling Joker that gains +6 Mult if you leave the shop with exactly 10$ (I'd describe it as common Obelisk, has great scaling but feels miserable to use)

# Version 1.1.0 (+2 new Jokers)

# Uncommon
## Pinata
A 'food' (if you like eating papier-mâché) Joker that gives you 2 random consumables at the beginning of each round for next 3 rounds. 

## Aristocracy
Fancy counterpart of Riff-Raff which spawns a Wraith card at the end of every Ante.

# Version 1.2.0 (+1 new Joker)
# Common
## Ransom Joker
A +Chips scaling Joker that gains the arithmetic mean of all cards played's chips.

# Version 1.3.0 (-1 Joker, +2 new Jokers)
# Uncommon
## Four-leaf Mirror
A replacement for Alloy (which was scrapped because it was banal and had lame art), makes Lucky and Glass cards count and act as each other.

# Common
## Love Letter
1 in 2 chance to turn scored cards to Hearts if played hand contains a Pair (with love from Lusty Joker)

# Version 1.4.0 (+1 Joker)

## Comeback
Gives X4 XMult if you played your last discarded poker hand
